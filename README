Imputation using Local Phylogeny

J. Wang, F. Villena, H. Lawson, J. Cheverud,
G. Churchill, and L. McMillan. Imputation
of SNPs in inbred mice using local phylogeny.
Genetics, 190(2):449â€“458, 2012

Requires Python 2.[6+]

usage: python impute.py <seqFile> <cliqueFile> <outputFile> <targetStrain>

Make sure of a few things:
1. Format of input files is what is expected (see comments in the code)
2. targetStrain name is exactly as it appears in cliqueFile
3. Strain names in seqFile are exactly as they appear in cliqueFile
4. outputFile will be overwritten if it exists - don't lose anything important
